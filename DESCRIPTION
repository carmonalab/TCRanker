Description: An algorithm to rank TCR clonotypes. Given a gene signature (exhaustion signature by default), clonotypes with identical TCR are ranked by their average signature score. This allows prioritizing sets of TCRs according to specific (and customizable) transcriptomics characteristics, e.g. exhaustion level, proliferation or clonotype size.
