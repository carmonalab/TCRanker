\usage{
TCRanker(
  query,
  tcr,
  signature = "default",
  assay = NULL,
  group = "none",
  FUN = "mean",
  minClonSize = 5,
  filterCell = "CD8T",
  keepObject = FALSE,
  species = "auto",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{\code{SingleCellExperiment} object, \code{Seurat} object or
Matrix/DF with query data.}

\item{tcr}{Vector containing TCRs clonotype info. or a simple entry name
(only when query is of \code{SingleCellExperiment / Saurat} object).}

\item{signature}{The gene signature that represents a cell status.
By default is the signature for exhaustion level of CD8+ T-cells.}

\item{assay}{Name of expression data assay, only valid for
\code{SingleCellExperiment / Saurat} object. By default
"counts" for \code{SingleCellExperiment} and
"RNA" for \code{Seurat}.}

\item{group}{Vector or a simple entry name (only when query is of
\code{SingleCellExperiment / Saurat} object). Extra grouping information
to be aggregated and included in the output. Same clonotype in different
groups would be aggregated separately. Even thought optional, it's still
recommended to be included.}

\item{FUN}{Function used to aggregate scores of the same clonotype. It could
be mean, median or customized functions that take a numeric vector or list
as input. By default, it uses "mean".}

\item{minClonSize}{Threshold of clonal size that would be taken into account,
5 by default.}

\item{filterCell}{Name of the sub cell type to filter using \code{scGate},
"CD8" by default. Set to "None" to disable (unfinished function)}

\item{keepObject}{Logical, to return the \code{SingleCellExperiment / Saurat}
object after scGate filtering or not (returned together with the ranking 
data frame in a list). Only valid with the query of 
\code{SingleCellExperiment / Saurat} object. False by default.}

\item{species}{Charactor, "mouse" or "human", optional.}
}
\value{
a data frame including clonal scores and ranking
 (and annotations, if \code{annotation} was included)
}
\description{
Calculates clonal scores of all different clonotypes for their level in a
 certain state, exhaustion level by default, and provides their final
 ranking. The ranking state could be customized by providing corresponding
 gene signature. For more details please see the help vignette:
\code{vignette("help", package = "TCRanker")}.
